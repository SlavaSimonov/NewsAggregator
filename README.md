# News Aggregator
A website that aggregates news from news sites rss. A user can select his favorite news websites, and the site will aggregate the news from them 

URL: *https://slavasimonov.github.io/NewsAggregator/*

## Presentation
![Site screenshot](./res/sitePic.png)

The site is written using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). For the design I have used [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)

I parse RSS feeds using [rss-parser](https://github.com/rbren/rss-parser#readme)

## Features
- Default list of news sites to choose from is provided
- It is possible to add more websites, if your favorite one is not on the list
- Your list of feeds will be stored in the browser. That means, that you need to set up your favorite websites only once
- News are sorted by date, so newer articles will be on the top of the page.
